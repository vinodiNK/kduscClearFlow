 #   Clearance management System for KDU Southern Campus
 
 ####  Developed a comprehensive Clearance Management System  for KDU Southern Campus, addressing the challenges faced by both administrators and students in manual clearance processes.

####  This web application offers a robust platform with distinct roles for administrators and clients, with clients representing heads of various campus facilities such as publications, mini marts, laundry services, gyms, etc. Clients can log in to the system to check if any students have outstanding clearance issues related to their respective facilities, streamlining the clearance verification process.
